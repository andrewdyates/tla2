//! Regression test for #6765: NRA stack overflow on small thread stacks.
//!
//! The NRA check loop requires more stack than the default Rust test-thread
//! allocation. Before the `stacker::maybe_grow` guard in `NraSolver::check()`,
//! this would abort with "thread has overflowed its stack".
//!
//! Runs the solver on a thread with a deliberately small (4 MiB) stack.
//! This file is its own integration-test binary, so a stack overflow still
//! aborts an isolated process even without an extra parent/child re-exec layer.
//! The executor's top-level `stacker::maybe_grow` guard (#6783) grows the stack
//! once before entering the solve pipeline. A 4 MiB thread is still smaller
//! than the default 8 MiB test stack while avoiding the debug-only 2 MiB
//! flake reproduced during prover verification.
