//! Guard bits for compiled clause deletion tracking.
//!
//! Each compiled clause has a `u8` guard value: 1 = active (propagate normally),
//! 0 = deleted (skip propagation). The guard array is indexed by clause arena
//! offset (the same ID used as the reason in propagation), allowing O(1)
//! deletion marking without recompilation.
//!
//! JIT-compiled propagation functions receive the guard array base pointer via
//! `PropagationContext::guards` and check `guards[clause_id]` before executing
//! clause logic. Since deletions are rare, the branch is well-predicted.
