//! SAT diagnostic JSONL writer for clause mutation provenance and result explanation.
//!
//! Emits structured JSONL events that explain *why* each SAT/UNSAT result is correct:
//! clause additions/deletions with pass attribution, variable lifecycle transitions,
//! and post-solve summaries with verification evidence.
//!
//! Activated via `Z4_DIAGNOSTIC=1` (or `Z4_DIAGNOSTIC_FILE=<path>`).
//! Zero overhead when disabled: the solver stores `Option<SatDiagnosticWriter>`,
//! and all emit methods early-return on `None`.
//!
//! See `designs/2026-02-15-issue-4211-structured-sat-diagnostic-mode.md` for the
//! full schema and execution plan.

// SAT solvers use domain acronyms (BVE, BCE, HTR) — consistent with crate convention.
