//! Tests for LIA incremental push/pop correctness.
//!
//! These tests exercise the interaction between incremental LIA solving
//! and push/pop scope management. The key invariant: assertions added inside
//! a push scope must not leak into subsequent scopes after pop.
//!
//! Regression context: issue #2777 fixed a scope-sync bug between SMT scopes and
//! `lia_persistent_sat`. These tests ensure scope soundness stays intact across
//! incremental path and fallback interleavings.
