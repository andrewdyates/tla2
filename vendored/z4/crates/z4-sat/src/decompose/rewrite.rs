/// Compute a rewrite plan for all clauses using the representative mapping.
///
/// This function is **read-only** with respect to `clause_db` — it returns a
/// `RewriteResult` containing all planned mutations as `ClauseMutation` entries.
/// The caller applies these mutations through the shared mutation protocol
/// in the solver integration code.
///
/// # Design (#3440)
///
/// Previously, this function took `&mut ClauseArena` and directly called
/// `clause_db.delete()` and `clause_db.replace()`. That bypassed the shared
/// mutation helpers in `mutate.rs`, creating a shadow mutation path. Now all
/// clause mutations are deferred to the caller, ensuring uniform watch,
/// proof, and diagnostic handling.
