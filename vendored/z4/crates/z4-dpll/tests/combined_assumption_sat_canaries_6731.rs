//! Assumption-side SAT canaries for combined theory routes (#6731 Packet 4).
//!
//! These tests verify that `check-sat-assuming` returns `sat` (not `unknown`)
//! for trivially SAT formulas through the combined AUFLIA/LIRA/AUFLIRA paths.
//!
//! The root cause of #6731 was inner `finalize_sat_model_validation()` running
//! against temporary preprocessed assertions instead of the original formula.
//! `with_deferred_postprocessing` fixes this by deferring validation to the
//! outer `check_sat_assuming()` boundary.
