//! Tests for LRA disequality split with non-unit coefficients (#6155).
//!
//! The LRA solver's DisequalitySplit computes the excluded value as `-constant`
//! without dividing by the coefficient. For `coeff*x + constant = 0`, the
//! excluded value should be `-constant/coeff`, not `-constant`.
//!
//! These tests verify correctness of disequality handling when coefficients
//! are non-trivial (e.g., `2*x != 6` means `x != 3`, not `x != 6`).
