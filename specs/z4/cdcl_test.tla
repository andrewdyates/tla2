---------------------------- MODULE cdcl_test ----------------------------
\* Runtime trace contract for z4-sat CDCL traces.
\* This spec is aligned with the emitted SAT trace schema/actions.

EXTENDS Integers, Sequences, FiniteSets, TLC

\* Number of SAT variables in the traced run.
CONSTANT NumVars

\* Upper bound on learned clauses (for finite model checking).
\* Real traces are bounded by 2^(2*NumVars) distinct clauses; this
\* constant limits state-space exploration while covering all
\* meaningful learning patterns.
CONSTANT MaxLearnedClauses

VarIndices == 0..(NumVars - 1)

\* A literal is <<varIndex, sign>> where sign is "pos" or "neg".
PosLit(v) == <<v, "pos">>
NegLit(v) == <<v, "neg">>
Literals == {<<v, s>> : v \in VarIndices, s \in {"pos", "neg"}}

\* Get the variable and sign of a literal.
Var(lit) == lit[1]
IsPositive(lit) == lit[2] = "pos"

\* Possible assignment values.
Values == {"TRUE", "FALSE", "UNDEF"}

\* Finite set of all prefixes of a trail (including empty trail).
\* TLC can enumerate this set, which keeps AnalyzeAndLearn executable.
TrailPrefixes(s) ==
    { IF i = 0 THEN <<>> ELSE SubSeq(s, 1, i) : i \in 0..Len(s) }

\* Finite set of trails with bounded length (needed for trace-validation
\* successor enumeration in terminal actions).
BoundedTrails ==
    UNION { [1..k -> Literals] : k \in 0..NumVars }

\* A trail is duplicate-free if no variable appears more than once.
DuplicateFreeTrail(t) ==
    \A i, j \in 1..Len(t) : i # j => Var(t[i]) # Var(t[j])

\* Bounded trails that also satisfy the duplicate-free requirement.
DuplicateFreeTrails ==
    { t \in BoundedTrails : DuplicateFreeTrail(t) }

\* Any literal on trail must agree with assignment.
TrailAssignmentConsistent(a, t) ==

                THEN a[Var(lit)] = "TRUE"
                ELSE a[Var(lit)] = "FALSE"

\* SAT-terminal consistency predicate reused by transition guards and invariants.
SatTerminalConsistent(a, t, d) ==
    /\ \A v \in VarIndices : a[v] # "UNDEF"
    /\ d \in 0..NumVars

\* SAT semantic correctness: terminal SAT must correspond to a total, consistent
\* assignment.
SatCorrect ==
    state = "SAT" =>
        SatTerminalConsistent(assignment, trail, decisionLevel)

\* UNSAT semantic correctness: UNSAT is only valid at root conflict level.
\* The trace spec has no clause structure, so we cannot check that a conflict
\* clause is falsified (as the abstract spec cdcl.tla does).  The structural
\* properties below are the strongest trace-level invariants: UNSAT requires
\* decision level 0 (no backtrack target) with a consistent trail.
\* Full unsatisfiability is verified externally via DRAT proofs.
UnsatCorrect ==
    state = "UNSAT" =>

\* Combined semantic gate for runtime trace validation.
