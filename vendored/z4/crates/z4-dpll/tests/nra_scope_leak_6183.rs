//! Regression test for NRA double-push scope leak (#6183).
//!
//! The NRA solver pushes two LRA scopes during check():
//!   1. Sign-cut scope (lib.rs:322) — model-derived sign bounds
//!   2. Patch scope (patch.rs:245) — tentative monomial patches
//!
//! Before the fix, `undo_tentative_patch()` used a boolean flag and
//! only popped ONE scope. This leaked the sign-cut scope's model-derived
//! bounds into future queries, potentially causing false UNSAT when the
//! leaked bounds excluded valid solutions.
//!
//! This test exercises the incremental path (push/pop) where sign-cut
//! scope leak would cause the second check-sat to fail.

/// Test that NRA correctly handles two queries where the first triggers
/// sign-cut + tentative patch, and the second should be SAT with a
/// different sign assignment.
///
/// If the sign-cut scope leaks, the second query inherits model-dependent
/// bounds (e.g., x > 0) that exclude the valid solution (e.g., x = -2).

    // sign-cut scope (x > 0, y > 0) and try_tentative_patch.

    // Second check-sat (after pop + new assertions):
    // x < 0 AND x * y = 6 AND y < 0

    // leaked x > 0 from the first query, this would be UNSAT.
