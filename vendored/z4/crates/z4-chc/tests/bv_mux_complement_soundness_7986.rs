//! Regression test for #7986: BV mk_mux complement optimization soundness.
//!
//! Root cause: z4-theories/bv/src/gates.rs `mk_mux` used XNOR(sel, b) instead
//! of XNOR(sel, a) when branches are complements (a = -b). This inverts the
//! mux output, causing the BV solver to return false-UNSAT on satisfiable
//! formulas involving `(ite (= #b1 (extract K K x)) bit_K (not bit_K))`.
//!
//! In CHC context, the BV solver's false-UNSAT on reachability queries causes
//! PDR/BMC to believe error states are unreachable, producing a false Safe
//! (PROOF) verdict on systems that are actually unsafe (CTREX).
//!
//! Fixed by: 44aafc14b (mk_xnor(sel, a) instead of mk_xnor(sel, b))
//! Upstream: zani#4217 (prove_safety_only::assert_hides_ub false proof)

/// Minimal BV CHC problem exercising the complement-branch mux pattern.
///
/// The system has one predicate `inv(x : BV8, b : Bool)` where `b` tracks
/// whether bit 0 of `x` is set. The transition uses `extract 0 0` to link
/// the Bool and BV state. The error condition checks that `b = true` implies
/// bit 0 of `x` is 1 — but the init clause sets `x = #x00` (bit 0 = 0) AND
/// `b = true`, which is immediately contradicted by the error check.
///
/// Actually, this system is UNSAFE because the initial state has x=#x00, b=true
/// and the query checks (inv(x,b) AND b AND (extract 0 0 x) = #b0) => false.
/// Since x=#x00 has bit 0 = 0 and b=true, the error is reachable at depth 0.
///
/// The mk_mux complement bug would cause the BV solver to incorrectly evaluate
/// the extract-based ITE, potentially making it think the error is unreachable.
