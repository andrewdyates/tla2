//! Regression test for issue #3041: AUFLIA solver non-determinism.
//!
//! The AUFLIA solver returned Unsat for a satisfiable formula ~60% of the time
//! due to non-deterministic HashMap iteration order in hashbrown (random seeds
//! per process). The fix sorts collected vectors from HashMap/HashSet iterations
//! in EUF's rebuild_closure(), check(), explain(), and Nelson-Oppen interface
//! term evaluation.

/// #3041: AUFLIA formula with quantifier instantiation must produce deterministic results.
///
/// This formula uses forall quantifiers with explicit :pattern triggers that have
/// matching ground terms (f(a), f(b)), ensuring E-matching instantiation occurs.
/// Before the fix, hashbrown's random hash seeds caused non-deterministic iteration
/// of EUF's `assigns` HashMap in `rebuild_closure()`, leading to different union-find
/// representative assignments, different congruence closure results, and spurious
/// UNSAT conclusions.
