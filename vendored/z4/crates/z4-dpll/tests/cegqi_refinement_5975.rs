//! Regression tests for issue #5975: CEGQI refinement false-UNSAT on mixed
//! UF+arithmetic quantifiers.
//!
//! When CEGQI refinement re-solves and gets UNSAT, disambiguation is needed
//! to determine whether the UNSAT is genuine or CE-induced. Without
//! disambiguation, satisfiable formulas may nondeterministically return UNSAT.
//!
//! The fix adds `disambiguate_cegqi_unsat` to both `try_cegqi_arith_refinement`
//! and `try_cegqi_neighbor_enumeration`, which re-solves without CE lemmas to
//! check if UNSAT is genuine.
