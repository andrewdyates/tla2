//! Propagator trait: the interface all CP constraints implement.
//!
//! A propagator is a constraint-specific inference engine. Given the current
//! variable domains, it prunes values that cannot participate in any solution.
//! Critically, every pruning must produce an **explanation** — a set of
//! SAT literals that justify the pruning. This enables CDCL conflict analysis.
//!
//! # Example: AllDifferent Bounds Propagator
//!
//! Given `alldiff(x, y, z)` with `x ∈ [1,3], y ∈ [1,3], z ∈ [1,3]`:
//! - No bounds propagation possible (all can take distinct values).
//!
//! Given `alldiff(x, y, z)` with `x ∈ [1,2], y ∈ [1,2], z ∈ [1,3]`:
//! - x and y must use {1, 2}, so z cannot be 1 or 2.
//! - Propagate: `z ∈ [3,3]`.
//! - Explanation: `[x <= 2] ∧ [y <= 2] ∧ [x >= 1] ∧ [y >= 1] → [z >= 3]`.
