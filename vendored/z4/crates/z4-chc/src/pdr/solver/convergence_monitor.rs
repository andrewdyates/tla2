//! Convergence monitor enhancements for graduated stagnation response (#7906).
//!
//! This module extends the base `ConvergenceMonitor` (defined in `mod.rs`) with:
//! 1. **Graduated response levels** (Warn -> Throttle -> Abort) instead of binary detection
//! 2. **Convergence health** (Healthy -> Slowing -> Stagnating -> Stuck) combining
//!    stagnation response with lemma quality signals
//! 3. **Lemma quality tracking**: push ratio, clause size trend, duplicate rate,
//!    and generalization success/failure ratio
//! 4. **Adaptive thresholds** that scale with problem size
//!
//! The base struct in `mod.rs` retains the core fields. This module adds the
//! extension types (`StagnationResponse`, `ConvergenceHealth`, `ProblemSizeHint`,
//! `LemmaQualityMetrics`) and the extended `impl` block with graduated methods.
