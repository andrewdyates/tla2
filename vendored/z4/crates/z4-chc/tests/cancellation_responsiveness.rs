//! Cancellation responsiveness tests for CHC engines.
//!
//! These tests verify that each engine responds promptly to cancellation requests.
//! Per the portfolio cancellation contract (designs/2026-01-27-chc-portfolio-ux-cancellation.md),
//! engines must poll CancellationToken frequently enough that they return within a bounded
//! time after cancellation.
//!
//! We test "pre-cancellation": cancel the token BEFORE starting the engine, then verify
//! the engine detects the cancelled state and returns Unknown almost immediately.
//!
//! Part of #1005.
