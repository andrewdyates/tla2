// Online forward DRUP checker. CaDiCaL `checker.cpp` (Biere 2021) parity.
//
// Adapter over `z4_drat_check::checker::DratChecker` — the BCP engine,
// RUP verification, and clause database are shared. This file adds:
//   - Literal type conversion (z4-sat ↔ z4-proof-common, zero-cost via index)
//   - Incremental push/pop for scoped solving (debug builds only)
//   - Trusted transform validation (non-RUP inprocessing clauses)
//   - Graceful RUP failure handling for inprocessing clauses (#7929)
