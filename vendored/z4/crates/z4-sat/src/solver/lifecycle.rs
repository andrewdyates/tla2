//! Variable lifecycle state machine.

//! Ports CaDiCaL's `flags.hpp`/`flags.cpp` variable status tracking to Z4.
//! Each variable has a lifecycle state that governs which solver operations
//! may touch it. This replaces the previous `eliminated: Vec<bool>` which
//! conflated BVE-eliminated and SCC-substituted variables.
//!

/// Variable lifecycle state, matching CaDiCaL's `Flags::status`.

/// State transitions:
/// - `Active -> Fixed`: root-level unit propagation (permanent)
/// - `Active -> Eliminated`: bounded variable elimination (BVE)
/// - `Active -> Substituted`: equivalent literal substitution (SCC decompose)
/// - `{Eliminated, Substituted} -> Active`: reactivation (incremental push)
///
/// `Fixed` is permanent — variables assigned at decision level 0 can never be
