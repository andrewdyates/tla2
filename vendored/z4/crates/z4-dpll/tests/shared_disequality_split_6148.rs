//! Regression tests for Nelson-Oppen shared disequality expression splits (#6148).
//!
//! When EUF forwards a shared disequality like f(x) != f(y) to LRA via the
//! Nelson-Oppen channel, LRA creates internal slack variables for f(x) and f(y).
//! The resulting expression `var_fx - var_fy != 0` has 2 variables, so the
//! single-variable DisequalitySplit path doesn't apply. Before the fix, this
//! fell through to TheoryResult::Unknown. The fix returns NeedExpressionSplit
//! for multi-variable shared disequalities, matching the regular disequality handler.
