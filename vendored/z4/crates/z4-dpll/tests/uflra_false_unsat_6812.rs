//! Regression test for #6812: false-UNSAT on QF_UFLRA benchmark.
//!
//! The benchmark `cpachecker-induction.modulus_true-unreach-call.i.smt2` has
//! `:status sat` but z4 previously returned UNSAT. Root cause: expression
//! split clauses (from N-O disequality enforcement) add hard constraints
//! derived from model evaluations, not from the formula itself. When the SAT
//! solver derives UNSAT from these added clauses, the result is unsound.
//!
//! Fix: escalate UNSAT to Unknown when the split loop has added expression
//! split clauses. The result should be `sat` or `unknown`, never `unsat`.
//!
//! Part of #6812
