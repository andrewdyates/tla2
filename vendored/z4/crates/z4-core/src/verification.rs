//! Typed verification contract for SAT/SMT model validation.
//!
//! Every internal verification site in the SAT/SMT pipeline returns one of
//! three typed outcomes: [`Verified`](VerificationVerdict::Verified),
//! [`Incomplete`](VerificationVerdict::Incomplete), or
//! [`Violated`](VerificationVerdict::Violated). No caller should infer these
//! states from English substrings.
//!
//! See `designs/2026-03-12-issue-5777-typed-verification-contract.md` for the
//! full design rationale.
