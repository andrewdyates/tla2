//! Inprocessing Soundness Gate Tests (#3428)
//!
//! Each inprocessing feature is tested in isolation against known-UNSAT
//! benchmarks to prevent the enable/disable soundness cycle:
//!   1. Worker enables feature
//!   2. Wrong-UNSAT/SAT discovered much later
//!   3. Feature disabled, investigation begins
//!
//! Gate protocol: a feature may only be re-enabled (default true) when
//! it passes all gate tests in isolation mode (all other inprocessing
//! features disabled).
