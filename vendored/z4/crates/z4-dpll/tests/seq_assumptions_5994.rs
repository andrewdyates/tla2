//! Regression tests for #5994: check-sat-assuming with QF_SEQ/QF_SEQLIA
//! must use combined EUF+Seq solver (not bare SeqSolver).
//!
//! Before fix, check-sat-assuming routed through `TheoryKind::Seq` which
//! creates a bare `SeqSolver` — missing EUF transitivity, LIA constraints,
//! and seq.len/seq.nth axiom injection, producing false SAT.
//!
//! Note: the separate `seq.nth` variable-indirection false-SAT gap (#6236) is
//! intentionally not represented as a passing test here. A regression test that
//! accepts the current wrong `sat` answer is misleading and would fail if the
//! solver later returns the correct `unsat`.
