//! Non-convex UFLIA/AUFLIA correctness tests (#4906).
//!
//! These problems involve non-convex theory combinations where the solver
//! must correctly handle disjunctive constraints + UF congruence. On these
//! specific instances, CDCL case splitting on the disjunctions provides
//! enough information for EUF congruence to derive the result — so these
//! tests validate the overall UFLIA/AUFLIA pipeline correctness, not
//! specifically the `discover_model_equality` phase-hint mechanism.
//!
//! True model-equality-requiring problems need LIA to fix variable values
//! via bounds (not disjunctions), where the equality is implicit in the
//! model but not expressible as a CDCL clause. Such tests are harder to
//! construct because the interface bridge's `evaluate_and_propagate` also
//! handles constant-matching cases.
//!
//! Reference: Z3 smt_context.cpp:4576-4632 (assume_eq + try_true_first).
