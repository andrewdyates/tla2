//! Regression tests for #5947: LIRA solver returns SAT for UNSAT Big-M ReLU
//! encoding. The formula uses mixed Int/Real constraints with a `to_real`
//! coercion. The N-O combination must correctly propagate the integer
//! assignment for the shared variable across the Int/Real theory boundary.

/// Big-M ReLU encoding: phase_2 in {0,1} controls relu_1 activation.
///
/// With phase_2=1: relu_1 = lin_0 = X_0 <= 0.5, so Y_0 <= 0.5 < 1.0
/// With phase_2=0: relu_1 <= M*0 = 0 and relu_1 >= 0, so relu_1 = 0, Y_0 = 0 < 1.0
/// Both cases: Y_0 < 1.0, contradicting (>= Y_0 1.0). UNSAT.
///
/// Regression: z4 returned SAT with phase_2=0, relu_1=1.0 (violating relu_1 <= M*phase_2=0).
/// Root cause: N-O cross-sort propagation only forwarded tight LIA bounds; non-tight but
/// integer-valued simplex assignments (0 <= phase_2 <= 1 with assignment 0) were not
/// propagated to LRA, so LRA could assign a different value to the shared variable.
