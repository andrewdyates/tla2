//! Tests for EUF disequality propagation orientation (#6152).
//!
//! The EUF solver must correctly match disequality orientations when propagating
//! equalities as false. When (a != b) is asserted and a later equality (= c d)
//! has c in the same class as b and d in the same class as a (swapped orientation),
//! the solver must swap the match to produce correct explanations.
//!
//! Finding 1 from #6152: the orientation guard is a debug_assert that is compiled
//! out in release mode. These tests verify the propagation path works in both modes.
