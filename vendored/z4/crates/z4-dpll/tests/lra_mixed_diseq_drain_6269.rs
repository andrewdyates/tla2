//! Regression tests for LRA pending_diseq_splits buffer management (#6269).
//!
//! When check() encounters both single-variable disequalities (which get
//! buffered in pending_diseq_splits) AND multi-variable disequalities (which
//! trigger an early NeedExpressionSplit return), the buffered single-var splits
//! must be drained by the NeedExpressionSplit handler. Without the drain,
//! the buffered splits are silently lost and must be re-discovered on the
//! next check() call, causing redundant work.
//!
//! The clear at check() start (#6269 fix in ad407906f) prevents *duplicate*
//! splits, while the drain in the expression split handler (#6269 acceptance
//! criteria 2) prevents *lost* splits.
