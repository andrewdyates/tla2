/// `SolverScope` restores the solver to the scope depth it had before
/// construction. Additional scopes pushed through the dereferenced solver are
/// also popped on drop. Popping or resetting the solver below the guard's entry
/// depth via [`Solver::try_pop`], [`Solver::pop`], [`Solver::try_reset`],
/// [`Solver::reset`], or [`Solver::try_reset_assertions`] violates that
/// invariant and will panic on drop unless the thread is already unwinding.
///
/// # Panics
///
/// On the normal path, dropping the guard panics if the solver's scope stack
/// has already been unwound below the guard's entry depth or if `try_pop()`
/// fails while restoring the entry depth.
