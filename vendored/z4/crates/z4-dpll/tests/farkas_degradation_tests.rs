//! Regression tests for #5536: Farkas graceful degradation.
//!
//! When Farkas certificate verification fails (structural or semantic),
//! the solver must keep the conflict clause for CDCL learning instead of
//! returning Unknown. The conflict literals are derived from sound simplex
//! analysis — only the proof certificate is invalid.
//!
//! These tests exercise the degradation path at the executor level by
//! running QF_LRA problems that trigger Farkas conflict generation.
//! A separate unit-level test in extension.rs (added in same session,
//! requires Worker commit) verifies the MockTheory path directly.
