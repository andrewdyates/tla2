//! End-to-end tests for issue #5911: capture-avoiding substitution in
//! quantifier instantiation.
//!
//! These tests exercise the full solver pipeline (frontend → preprocessing →
//! Skolemization → E-matching/CEGQI → SAT) with nested quantifiers where
//! inner and outer scopes share variable names. The key invariant: substituting
//! a term for an outer variable must never corrupt an inner variable with the
//! same name.

use ntest::timeout;
mod common;

/// Nested forall with same-named bound variables.
///
/// (forall ((x Int)) (forall ((x Int)) (= x 0))) says "for all x, for all x,
/// x = 0" which is equivalent to "for all y, 0 = 0" (the inner x shadows the
/// outer x). This is UNSAT because the inner forall claims every integer is 0.
///
/// If capture-avoidance is broken, the outer x substitution could leak into the
/// inner forall, producing a SAT result (the solver would think the inner body
/// only needs to hold for the specific outer x value).
