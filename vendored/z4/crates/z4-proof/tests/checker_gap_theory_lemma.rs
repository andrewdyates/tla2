/// The proof checker accepts semantically invalid theory lemmas.

/// Constructs a proof where:
/// - Assume x (true)
/// - Assume y (true)
/// - TheoryLemma from "FAKE_THEORY" claiming (not x, not y)
/// - Resolve (not x, not y) with (x) on pivot x → (not y)
/// - Resolve (not y) with (y) on pivot y → empty clause
///
/// No real theory can derive (not x, not y) from nothing. The proof
/// is structurally complete but semantically unsound. The checker
/// accepts it because `validate_step` pushes TheoryLemma clauses
/// directly into `derived_clauses` without verification (checker.rs:120).
///
/// This means proofs with bogus theory lemmas pass the checker.
/// For proof-based Craig interpolation (#4173), this is a soundness
/// risk: interpolants derived from invalid theory lemmas are incorrect.
///
/// Fixing requires either:
/// (a) theory-specific validation callbacks per TheoryLemmaKind, or
/// (b) strict mode that rejects TheoryLemma (like strict rejects Trust).
