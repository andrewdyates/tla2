//! End-to-end tests for #5230: pairwise value equality discovery in InterfaceBridge.
//!
//! Before this fix, the bridge only propagated `arith_term = const_term`
//! equalities. If two interface terms evaluated to the same value but that
//! value had no matching constant in the formula, no equality was discovered.

/// QF_UFLIA: Two UF applications equal via arithmetic, no matching constant.
///
/// `f(x)` with `x=3` evaluates `f(3)`, and `g(y)` with `y=3` evaluates `g(3)`.
/// EUF knows `f(3) = g(3)` by congruence. But the *result* values also matter:
/// we need the bridge to discover that the *output* of `f` and `g` are equal.
///
/// Here `(+ a 1)` and `(+ b 2)` both evaluate to 4 when `a=3, b=2`, but 4
/// is never a constant in the formula. The pairwise bridge discovers
/// `(+ a 1) = (+ b 2)` and propagates it to EUF.
