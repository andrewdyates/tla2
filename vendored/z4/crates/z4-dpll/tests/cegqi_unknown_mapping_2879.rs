//! #2879: CEGQI re-solve Unknown→SAT mapping is unsound when ground solver
//! returns Unknown for the category.
//!
//! When CEGQI's forall disambiguation re-solves the ground formula without CE
//! lemmas, the result may be Unknown (e.g., if the logic category is not
//! handled in the re-solve match). The old code mapped this to SAT via a
//! catch-all `_` arm. The fix maps Unknown/Err to Unknown.

/// A valid forall with LIRA ground should not return "unsat".
/// Before #2879 fix, the catch-all in the re-solve match mapped Unknown to
/// SAT. After the fix, it maps to Unknown. Both SAT and Unknown are
/// acceptable; UNSAT would be unsound.
