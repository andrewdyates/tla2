//! Performance proof tests for z4-sat algorithmic complexity.
//!
//! These tests demonstrate and bound the cost of critical operations using
//! pure cost models. They prove the quadratic vs linear complexity difference
//! for key inprocessing patterns and serve as regression documentation.
//!
//! Findings (Prover audit, 2026-02-12):
//!
//! HIGH severity (production path):
//! 1. reduce_db remove_watch: O(D*W) — inprocessing.rs:636-648
//! 2. reason_clause_set allocation: O(C) per call × 6 calls — reduction.rs:62-71
//!
//! LOW severity (test-only path):
//! 3. find_elimination_candidate: O(E*V) — bve.rs:446-502
//!    (Production uses schedule-based next_candidate: O(V log V + E))
//!
//! Memory blowup risks (HIGH):
//! 4. ClauseTrace unbounded (clause_trace.rs:36) — SMT only
//! 5. ClauseDB headers never reclaimed (clause_db.rs:135)
//! 6. ReconstructionStack unbounded (reconstruct.rs:61)
//!
//! Findings (Prover audit, 2026-02-15, session 1):
//!
//! HIGH severity:
//! 7. ClearLevel0 reason scan: O(num_vars) per deletion — mutate.rs:189-193
//!    BVE deletes O(K) clauses, each scanning all vars → O(K*V) total
//!    Fix: scan clause literals only (O(clause_len)), invariant proven in
//!    test_reason_clause_contains_propagated_variable
//!
//! MEDIUM-HIGH severity:
//! 8. Arena literal leak: replace() orphans old literals — clause_db.rs:285-304
//!    compact() only fires on max_clause_db_bytes (defaults to None)
//!
//! LOW severity:
//! 9. Vivify sort-all-then-truncate: O(N log N) — inprocessing.rs:490
//!    select_nth_unstable_by would give O(N + K log K)
//!
//! Findings (Prover audit, 2026-02-15, session 2):
//!
//! HIGH severity (LRAT mode):
//! 10. Per-conflict O(V) allocations: 5 sites in conflict_analysis.rs + 4 in
//!     mutate.rs/inprocessing.rs allocate vec![false; num_vars] per call.
//!     At 10K conflicts/sec with 100K vars: ~3 GB/s allocation churn.
//!     Fix: reusable stamp arrays like minimize_visited/minimize_to_clear.
//!
//! MEDIUM severity (LRAT mode):
//! 11. push_lrat_hint pushes non-zero hints — mutate.rs:71
//!     Dedup: ProofManager::emit_add uses HashSet at output boundary (#5248).
//!
//! HIGH severity (production, proven):
//! 12. ClearLevel0 can be narrowed to clause literals — mutate.rs:189
//!     Invariant proven: reason[vi] == Some(cref) implies vi is in the clause.
//!     Fix: iterate clause_db.literals(clause_idx) instead of 0..num_vars.
//!
//! Findings (Prover audit, 2026-02-16, session 3 — memory_verification):
//!
//! MEDIUM severity (debug/release divergence):
//! 13. Side-effecting debug_assert in congruence — inprocessing.rs:2041-2044
//!     unit_forces_conflict() and is_rup_unit_under_negation() call
//!     decide()/propagate()/backtrack(0) inside debug_assert!. This increments
//!     num_propagations in debug builds but not release, shifting inprocessing
//!     scheduling (which uses num_propagations for effort budgets).
//!     Fix: extract the RUP check into a #[cfg(debug_assertions)] block before
//!     the assertion, storing the result in a local bool.
//!
//! LOW severity (tautological assertions):
//! 14. 3 tautological debug_assert sites in conflict_analysis.rs:
//!     - Line 272: counter==0 after loop that exits on counter==0
//!     - Line 646: is_empty() immediately after clear()
//!     - inprocessing.rs:658: val==0 in else-branch after val>0 and val<0
//!
//! Findings (Prover audit, 2026-02-16, session 4 — performance_proofs):
//!
//! Fix status review:
//!   FIXED #1: reduce_db now uses lazy deletion + flush_watches() batch compaction
//!             (reduction.rs:335-343). O(D*W) per-clause remove_watch is eliminated.
//!   FIXED #7/#12: ClearLevel0 now scans clause literals only (mutate.rs:190-212),
//!             O(clause_len) per deletion. O(num_vars) postcondition remains debug-only.
//!   OPEN #2: reason_clause_set still allocates vec![false; clause_db_len] per call.
//!   OPEN #10: Per-conflict vec![false; num_vars] allocations in LRAT mode (5+ sites).
//!   OPEN #11: push_unique_lrat_hint still uses Vec::contains (O(n²)).
//!
//! No new production-code quadratic patterns found. BCP inner loop, conflict
//! analysis, backtracking, and reduce_db are all clean. Remaining quadratic
//! patterns are concentrated in LRAT proof hint chain construction paths.
//!
//! LOW severity (LRAT mode, sub-pattern of #10):
//! 15. replace_clause_impl BFS queue initialization — mutate.rs:443
//!     `(0..num_vars).filter(|&v| needed_level0[v]).collect()` scans all vars
//!     when only O(old_clause_len) variables were marked in the preceding loop.
//!     Fix: collect marked variables during the marking loop (lines 424-437)
//!     instead of rescanning. Dominated by finding #10's allocation cost.
//!
//! Findings (Prover audit, 2026-02-17, session 7 — performance_proofs):
//!
//! LOW severity (OTFS Branch B, non-proof mode):
//! 17. OTFS Branch B LBD uses Vec::contains O(n²) — conflict_analysis.rs:320-329
//!     Inline LBD computation builds a fresh Vec and uses linear .contains() for
//!     dedup. Standard compute_lbd (conflict.rs:261) uses reusable O(1) workspace.
//!     For typical Branch B clauses (short after strengthening), this is benign.
//!     Fix: use ConflictAnalyzer::compute_lbd or the stamp-counter approach from
//!     recompute_glue (reduction.rs:99).
//!
//! LOW severity (OTFS Branch B, semantic):
//! 18. OTFS Branch B LBD excludes level-0 — conflict_analysis.rs:324
//!     `if lv > 0` filters out level-0 literals. Standard compute_lbd
//!     (conflict.rs:261) and recompute_glue (reduction.rs:99) count ALL levels.
//!     When the strengthened clause contains level-0 literals, Branch B produces
//!     a lower LBD value, giving a slightly optimistic signal to the Glucose
//!     restart EMA. Effect is small since OTFS fires rarely.
//!
//! CRITICAL (dirty tree, uncommitted — HBR subsumption in propagation.rs):
//! 19. Uncommitted HBR changes (unconditional unit_reason = Some(hbr_ref) +
//!     subsumption deletion restore) cause panic on ecarev benchmark:
//!     "BUG: no seen literal found in trail during conflict analysis"
//!     (conflict_analysis.rs:387). Root cause: HBR clause creation during probing
//!     persists beyond probe backtracking and corrupts reason chains in regular
//!     CDCL. CaDiCaL isolates this with probe_reason array; Z4 uses main reason[].
//!     This validates Prover bisection commit 9b09f32d8: HBR clause creation is
//!     the root cause, not subsumption deletion alone.

// Findings (Prover audit, 2026-02-18, session 10 — performance_proofs):
//
// Cross-crate theory solver findings:
//
// MEDIUM-HIGH severity (simplex hot loop):
// 20. Simplex pivot Vec::insert/Vec::remove is O(V) per coefficient update — lra/types.rs:35-48
//     Pivot iterates R rows × V coefficients, each calling add_sparse_term which does
//     binary_search (O(log V)) + insert/remove (O(V) shift). Total per pivot: O(R * V²).
//     Z3 uses dense row representation for small tableaux, switching to sparse CSR for large.
//     This is the standard sorted-coefficient simplex representation; cache-friendly but
//     shift-heavy. Acceptable for typical SMT tableaux (V < 1000) but scales poorly.
//     Fix: For V > threshold, switch to HashMap-based sparse representation.
//
// MEDIUM severity (reason dedup in theory check):
// 21. Reason dedup via `reasons.iter().any()` in 6 sites across LRA/LIA — O(R²):
//     - lra/lib.rs:707 (get_value_with_reasons)
//     - lra/optimization.rs:103 (is_forced_to_value case 2)
//     - lra/optimization.rs:180 (is_forced_to_value case 3 lower)
//     - lra/optimization.rs:190 (is_forced_to_value case 3 upper)
//     - lia/theory_impl.rs:655 (propagate_equalities)
//     Each site appends to a Vec with linear contains-check for dedup.
//     R is typically small (single-digit) but called frequently during check().
//     Fix: Use HashSet<TermId> for dedup, or accept small-R invariant.
//
// MEDIUM severity (proof construction):
// 22. Proof resolution retain+clone loop — executor/proof.rs:535-548
//     `derive_empty_via_trust_lemma` and `try_derive_empty_via_theory_resolution`
//     iterate A assumptions, each calling retain(O(C)) + clone(O(C)) on a shrinking
//     clause. Total: A + (A-1) + ... + 1 = O(A²). Called once per UNSAT proof.
//     For BV bit-blasting proofs, A can be large (hundreds).
//     Fix: Use indexed set for O(1) removal, avoid clone by passing reference.
//
// MEDIUM severity (misleading complexity claims):
// 23. arrays/lib.rs:334 `known_equal` claims O(1) but has O(depth) affine fallback
// 24. arrays/lib.rs:492 `known_distinct_direct` claims O(1) but has O(depth) affine fallback
// 25. walk.rs:117 Walker claims O(1) amortized but per-flip is O(degree)
//     Status: docstrings FIXED in worktree (for Worker commit).
//
// Memory findings (CHC solver):
// 26. PDR frame lemmas grow without eviction — pdr/frame.rs:377-493
//     Only dedup prevents duplicates; no size cap on unique lemmas per frame.
//     N frames × M unique lemmas × expr_size = unbounded memory growth.
//
// 27. PDR solver 15+ FxHashMap caches with 219K max aggregate entries — pdr/solver.rs:176-399
//     Eviction is "nuke the cache" (clear all on cap hit). HashMap memory not returned.
//     Individual caps exist but aggregate is large.
//
// 28. String CEGAR accumulates clauses across iterations — executor/theories/strings.rs:693-806
//     `string_lemma_clauses: Vec<Vec<TermId>>` grows monotonically across CEGAR iterations.
//     Bounded by MAX_SPLITS_LIA iteration count.
