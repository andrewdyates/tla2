//! End-to-end benchmarks for issue #3325: E-matching improvements for
//! quantifier-unknown reduction.
//!
//! These tests demonstrate formulas that return a definitive result (sat/unsat)
//! thanks to the E-matching pipeline (Phase A + B1b + B1c), where incomplete
//! quantifier handling would otherwise return `unknown`.
//!
//! Each test is modeled on realistic verification condition patterns from
//! downstream consumers (sunder, certus) that depend on quantifier reasoning.

use ntest::timeout;
mod common;

/// Inverse function axioms with congruence-derived matching.
///
/// This tests the full E-matching pipeline including Phase B1c:
///   forall x. f(g(x)) = x    (trigger: f(g(x)))
///   forall x. g(f(x)) = x    (trigger: g(f(x)))
///   b = g(a)                  (ground fact)
///   f(b) != a                 (negated postcondition)
///
/// Reasoning chain:
///   1. b = g(a) → ground term g(a) exists
///   2. f(g(a)) matches trigger f(g(x)) with x=a → f(g(a)) = a
///   3. b = g(a) + congruence: f(b) = f(g(a))
///   4. f(b) = f(g(a)) = a, contradicting f(b) != a
///
/// Steps 2-3 require E-matching to see f(b) and f(g(a)) as congruent via the
/// EUF model (Phase B1c) or explicit rewriting.
