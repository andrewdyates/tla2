//! Regression test for issue #6563: per-instance term memory isolation.
//!
//! Before the fix, `GLOBAL_TERM_BYTES` was a process-wide `AtomicUsize` counter.
//! When multiple `Solver` instances ran concurrently in the same process, their
//! combined term allocation could exceed `DEFAULT_TERM_MEMORY_LIMIT` (4GB), causing
//! `global_memory_exceeded()` to return `true` for both instances even though neither
//! individually exceeded the budget. This produced non-deterministic `Unknown` results.
//!
//! The fix adds `instance_term_bytes` to `TermStore` so each solver tracks its own
//! allocation independently.
