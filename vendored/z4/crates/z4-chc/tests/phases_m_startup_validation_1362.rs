// Soundness guard for #1362: phases_m must never return Unsafe.
//
// PDR can discover a parity invariant for phases_m through conjunct
// decomposition, and the startup path accepts it via the free_vars_sanitized
// fallback. However, whether PDR discovers the invariant within budget is
// non-deterministic. Safe and Unknown are both acceptable; Unsafe would be
// a soundness bug (this benchmark is known-safe).

///
/// This benchmark has an explicit mod constraint in its transitions:
///   (= (mod __p0_a0 2) 0)
/// The system is known-safe. Returning Unsafe would indicate a soundness bug.
/// Returning Unknown is acceptable (non-deterministic invariant discovery).
/// Returning Safe confirms the startup model acceptance fallback (#1362) works.
