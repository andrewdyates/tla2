//! Vivification - clause strengthening via unit propagation
//!
//! Vivification is an inprocessing technique that strengthens clauses by testing
//! if literals can be removed. For each clause C = (l1 ∨ l2 ∨ ... ∨ ln):
//!
//! 1. For each literal l_i in order:
//!    - Temporarily assume ¬l_i
//!    - Propagate unit clauses
//!    - If conflict or another literal in C becomes unit, the clause can be shortened
//!
//! The actual vivification loop lives in `solver/inprocessing.rs` where it has
//! direct access to solver state. This module provides supporting types.
//!
//! Reference:
//! - Piette, Hamadi, Saïs: "Vivification" (SAT 2008)
//! - CaDiCaL implementation (src/vivify.cpp)
