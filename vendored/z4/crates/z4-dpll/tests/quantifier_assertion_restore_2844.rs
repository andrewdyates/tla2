//! Regression tests for issue #2844: check_sat_internal permanently corrupts ctx.assertions.
//!
//! The quantifier processing block in check_sat_internal used to permanently remove
//! quantified assertions via `retain()` and accumulate E-matching instantiations.
//! This caused consecutive check-sat calls to see a mutated assertion set.
