//! Z4 Constraint types.
//!
//! Constraints are the fundamental building blocks of verification problems.
//! They represent conditions that must hold (assertions) or can be assumed
//! (assumptions).
//!
//! ## Constraint Types
//!
//! - **Assert**: A condition that must be proven to hold.
//! - **Assume**: A condition that can be assumed true (hypothesis).
//! - **SoftAssert**: An optimization goal (for MaxSAT-like problems).
//!
//! ## SMT-LIB2 Mapping
//!
//! | Constraint | SMT-LIB2 |
//! |------------|----------|
//! | Assert(e) | (assert e) |
//! | Assume(e) | (assert e) ; assumptions become assertions |
//! | CheckSat | (check-sat) |
