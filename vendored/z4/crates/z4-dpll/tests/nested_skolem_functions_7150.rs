//! Regression tests for issue #7150: nested existential Skolem functions.
//!
//! These cases used to degrade to `unknown` because nested existentials were
//! only Skolemized to constants. The fix carries visible outer universal
//! binders into Skolemization so the witness can depend on them.

mod common;

/// `forall y. exists x. x > y` is satisfiable with witness `x = y + 1`.
///
/// The nested existential must be Skolemized to a function of `y`, not a
/// constant. Current HEAD still answers `unknown`, so the soundness contract is
/// "sat or unknown, but never unsat".
